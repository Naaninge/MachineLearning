# MachineLearning
This repository contains two machine learning projects that I worked on .The loan analysis model uses supervised learning to predict which
customers are most likely to pay back a bank loan or not based on features such as age,job_status,gender etc.Three supervising models were used, 
they are logistic regression,decision tree and random forest.These models were compared to each other to observe which one had the highest accuracy and their
hyperparameters were also tuned to get better results.

The second project was part of the DARA hackthon challenge in which my group members and I worked on flood detection based on the Mozambique flood of 2017.
We used an unsupervised  model called K-means cluster and segmentation
to determine how flooded a region was on certain days.We used 6 satellite images of different days  before,during and after the flood and used the segmentation and the
K-means cluster to find patterns in the images so that we could determine the level of flooding in the region on the days not included in our dataset.
